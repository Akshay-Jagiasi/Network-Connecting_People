# Network-Connecting_People

Website Url: https://network-connecting-people.netlify.app/

This project has been a great learning experience for me. I became more familiar with ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I also had the opportunity to work with Redux, a library for managing application state, and Material UI, a library of React components that implement the material design guidelines.
I also gained knowledge about Firebase, a platform for managing data and user authentication. I learned how to use Firebase's real-time database and authentication system to create a seamless and secure user experience.
